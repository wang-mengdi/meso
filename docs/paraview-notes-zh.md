# In Paraview, how to draw codimensional-1 particles with circles?
1. Export arrays of particle positions and normals (along with others) as unstructured grid (.vtu), without connectivity info.
2. Open Paraview, load the data.
3. Click on Filter taskbar, search: "2D Glyph", after that pops up, click on it.
4. Click Apply.
5. Go to Glyph Type, select Circle. Check the Filled checkbox.
6. Click the a2DGlyph1 (or whatever is newly generated by the previous step) in the Pipeline Browser, go to Filter taskbar, search "transform", click on it.
7. A new filter called Transform1 is generated, hit apply.
8. Goto the Properties of Transform1, Change Rotate: 0, 0, 0 to Rotate 0, 90, 0. Hit Apply.
9. Click the newly generated (Transform1) pipeline, go to Filter, search "Glyph With Custom Source", click on it. 
10. For Input, select your original .vtu file. For Glyph Source, select Transform1. Apply.
11. Choose Orientation Array to be the normal vector array.
12. Adjust the Scale Factor as needed.
